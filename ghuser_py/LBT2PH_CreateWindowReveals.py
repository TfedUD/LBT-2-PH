Will create geometry for the window 'reveals' (the sides, top and bottom for windows which are installed in a host surface). These are used to accurately calcualte the window shading factors. Will also generate 'punched' envelope surface geometry to allow for accurate shading assessment.

EM December 9, 2020
    Args:
        _HB_rooms: (list) The Honeybee-Rooms to use.
    Returns:
        HB_rooms_: A copy of the Honeybee-Rooms input.
        
        window_names_: A list of the window names in the order calculated.
        window_surfaces_: The window surfaces in the same order as the "window_names_" output. These surfaces will be pushed 'in' according to their 'InstallDepth' parameter and surface normal. If you are getting weird results, double check all your window surface normals are pointing 'out'.
        
        window_surrounds_: (Tree) Each branch represents one window object. The surfaces in each branch correspond to the Bottom, Left, Top and Right 'reveal' surfaces (in that order). These surfaces can be useful to calculate the shading factors for the window surface.
        envelope_surfaces_punched: The Honeybee-Room evelope surfaces, except with all the windows 'punched' out. This is useful for calculating shading factors on the inset window surfaces.
        envelope_surfaces_: The Honeybee Room exterior/envelope surfaces.

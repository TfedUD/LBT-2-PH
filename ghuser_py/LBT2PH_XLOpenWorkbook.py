"""
Enables the connection from Rhino to Excel.
> When _run is set to TRUE, this will start up a new instance of Microsoft Excel.
> If valid source and target file paths are provided, a new copy of the source PHPP will be created and automatically opened. 
> Once open, this new PHPP can be connected to the 'Write to Excel' or the 'Read from Excel' components.

    Args:
        _run: Set to True to enable the Excel application, False saves the open workbook and stops the application.
        _source_PHPP_filepath: (str) The existing filepath to the PHPP you would like to use as the 'source' for the new one.
        new_PHPP_filepath: (str) The new filepath to the PHPP you would like to create. If this file does not already exist it will be created by this component when _run==True.
    Returns:
        excel: The Excel COM interface created, or None if not running.
